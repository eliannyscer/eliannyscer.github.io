# Hash table or Hashmap

## What is Hash Table or Hash Map?

In short, Hash table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In this table, our data is stored in a array(list) format, where each data value have a unique key to represent the data. So in this way, access of data becomes very fast if we know the key of the desired data.

## How to Implement Hash Map in Python?

Well if youâ€™re looking for implementation of hash map in python then the answer is Dictionary. Python Dictionary is a built-in type that supports key-value pairs.

## Key features

* The key is unique and immutable.
* Ideal hashing should produce a different index for each key.
* In Python, dictionaries are examples of hash maps.
* In general, hash tables store key-value pairs and the key is generated using a hash function.
