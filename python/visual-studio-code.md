# Create a python document in Visual studio code

From the File Explorer toolbar, select the New File button or ctrl n. Name the file how you prefer "title`.py`". By using the `.py` file extension, you tell visual studio code to interpret this file as a Python program, so that it evaluates the contents with the Python.

`Note:` The File Explorer toolbar also allows you to create folders  to better organize your code. You can use the New folder button to quickly create a folder.

It's very comfortable to work because when you start typing you have the auto-completion options.
