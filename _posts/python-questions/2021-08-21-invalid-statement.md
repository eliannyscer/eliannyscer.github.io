`A)` numbers = 1,000,000

`B)` numbers = 1000 2000 3000

`C)` numbers = 1000, 2000, 3000

`D)` numbers = 1,000,000

`Answer: B) numbers = 1000 2000 3000`

`Whitespace` is not allowed in a variable names. If we write `number one` as a variable name it will be an invalid while using an `_` character between two words makes it a valid variable name. for example `number_one` is a valid variable name.
