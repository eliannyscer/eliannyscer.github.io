The compiling and linking allows the new extensions to be compiled properly without any error and the linking can be done only when it passes the compiled procedure.

* `Compilation` - Python first compiles your source code (.py file) into a format known as byte code. This step doesn't create anything the user can actually run. Instead, the compiler produces the `machine language instructions` that correspond to the source code file that was compiled, compilation is `simply a translation step`.

* `Linking` - It refers to the creation of a  executable file, is the final phase where all the functions are linked with their definitions as the linker knows where all these functions are implemented.
