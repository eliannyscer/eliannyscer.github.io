Yes, Python supports multiple inheritance.

A `class` can be  derived from more than one `base class`, this is called multiple inheritance. The features of all the base classes are inherited into the derived class (like in C++).

![Derived class](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20191222084630/multipleinh.png)

`Syntax:`

```python3
Class Base1:
       Body of the class

Class Base2:
     Body of the class

Class Derived(Base1, Base2):
     Body of the class
```
