There are mainly two types of functions:

* `Normal function` - It is  is defined by the keyword `def` and it has a name.

`Example:`

`my_func` is de name and we are using the keyword `def`.

```python3
def my_func(a, b, c):
    result = a + b + c
    return result
```

* `Lambda or anonymous function` - Is anonymous because it does not has a name and is defined by using the keyword `lambda`, this function consist only in one expression(one line of code).

`Example:`

```python

lambda a, b, c : a + b + c

#Even you can do more calculations
lambda a, b, c : a ** 3 + b + (c % 2)
lambda x : x % 2 == 0
```

`Note:` Any value is a expression like number or string.

## Additional information

## Syntax

```python3
lambda parameters: expression
```

`Lambda` – This is the `keyword` used to create a lambda function.

`Parameters` – It can have zero, one or many parameters. You just need to specify `comma`  to separate the parameters after the lambda keyword.

`Expression` – This is the body of the function. This is where you specify the operation and this can have only one expression.

## Comparison of lambda with a standard function

`Standard functions`

* Used many times.
* Require more lines of code lines of code.
* None or more returns.
* Named only.
* They can have multiple expression/statements in her body.

`Lambda function`
  
* You can use only one time.
* It requires a maximum of two lines of code.
* One or more return.
* Named or anonymous.
* They can have just a single expression in their body.
