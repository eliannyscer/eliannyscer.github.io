`A)` 31 characters.

`B)` 63 characters.

`C)` 79 characters.

`D)` None of the above.

`Answer:` "D". None of the above because identifiers are [unlimited](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers) in length.

## Additional information

`What are Python Identifiers?`

A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).

Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language.
