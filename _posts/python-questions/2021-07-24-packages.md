It is a container where you can save one o more relevant modules to organize. To create a package, you create a new folder and place the relevant modules in that folder, you need to add a `__init__.py` file in the folder otherwise python will not recognize as a package.

`Example:`

Suppose that you need to develop a large application.The app will have many modules. When the number of modules grows, itâ€™ll become difficult to keep all of them in one location. This is where packages come into play.
