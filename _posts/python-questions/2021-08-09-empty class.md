To write an empty class we use the `pass` statement, it is a special statement in Python that does nothing. It only works as a dummy statement. Objects of an empty class can also be created.

`Example:`

```python
class Ellie:
    pass
  
obj = Ellie()
print(obj)

#Output:
<__main__.Ellie object at 0x7f05f5461a30>
```
