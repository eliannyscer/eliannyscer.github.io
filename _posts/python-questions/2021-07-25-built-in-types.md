Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

* Text Type - `str`.

* Numeric Types - `int, float, complex`.

* Sequence Types - `list, tuple, range`.

* Mapping Typ - `dict`.

* Set Types - `set, frozenset`.

* Boolean Type - `bool`.
  
* Binary Types - `bytes, bytearray, memoryview`.
