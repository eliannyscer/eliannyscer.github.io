Yes, like other general purpose programming languages`(Java, C++. C#, Ruby)`, Python is also an `object-oriented` language. It allows us to design programs using classes and objects.

The object is related to real-word entities such as book, house, pencil, etc. The OOP's concept focuses on writing the reusable code.

## Additional information

`Object Oriented Programming (OOP)` - In order for a programming language to be object-oriented, it should have a mechanism to enable working with classes and objects.

`Class` - The class can be defined as a collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods.

`Object` - Everything in Python is an object. When we define a class, it needs to create an object to allocate the memory.
