The PEP is an abbreviation form of Python Enterprise Proposal. PEP 8 is a document that provides various guidelines to write the readable in Python. PEP 8 describes how the developer can write beautiful code.

`The main objective of PEP is to improve the readability and consistency of code`

The code can be written in a few minutes, a few hours, or a whole day but once we have written the code, we will never rewrite it again. But sometimes, we need to read the code again and again.

The code should reflect the meaning of each line. That's why readability is so much important.
