`Polymorphism` - The word means having many forms.

In programming, polymorphism means `same function name` (but different signatures) being uses for different types.

```python
# len() being used for a string
print(len("Ellie"))
  
# len() being used for a list
print(len([10, 20, 30]))

# Output:
5
3
```
